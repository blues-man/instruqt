title: Building Custom Notebook Images
description: |
  The [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) web site describes Jupyter notebooks as:

  > an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

  Jupyter notebooks can be deployed direct to Linux, macOS or Windows environments, or in containerized environments such as Docker, Kubernetes and OpenShift.

  In this workshop you will learn how you can build a custom container image which incorporates a set of Jupyter notebooks and the packages they require, and deploy the image to OpenShift.

  The examples shown will make use of sample Jupyter notebook images and templates from the [Jupyter on OpenShift](https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift) project, a community project for demonstrating how Jupyter notebooks and JupyterHub can be deployed to OpenShift.

  assignment: |
    The Jupyter on OpenShift project provides Jupyter notebook images which have been purpose built to work best with OpenShift.

    Before you can deploy these Jupyter notebook images, you first need to load the images for the Jupyter notebook application into your project in OpenShift. You only need to load this once in a project. You can then use it in creating as many different Jupyter notebook deployments as you need.

    In this workshop the step of loading the Jupyter notebook images has already been done for you.

    To verify that the images have been loaded run the command:

    ```
    oc get imagestreams -o name
    ```

    You should see that the `s2i-minimal-notebook` image stream exists.

    You can inspect the image stream by running:

    ```
    oc describe imagestream s2i-minimal-notebook
    ```

    You should see that the image stream includes tags for `3.5` and `3.6`. These correspond to versions of the image for Python 3.5 and Python 3.6.

  title: Topic 2 - Loading the Notebook Templates
  assignment: |
    The minimal Jupyter notebook images that have been loaded can be deployed as is, but to make it easier to secure access, add persistent storage, define resources, as well as use it as a Source-to-Image (S2I) builder to create custom Jupyter notebook images, the Jupyter on OpenShift project also provides a set of OpenShift templates.

    As with the Jupyter notebook images, for this workshop these have already been loaded for you.

    To verify that the templates have been loaded for you, run:

    ```
    oc get templates
    ```

    The purpose of the OpenShift templates which have been loaded are:

    * `notebook-deployer` - Template for deploying a Jupyter notebook image.

    * `notebook-builder` - Template for building a custom Jupyter notebook image using Source-to-Image (S2I) against a hosted Git repository. Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file of the Git repository will be installed and any files, including notebook images, will be copied into the image. The image can then be deployed using the `notebook-deployer` template.

    * `notebook-quickstart` - Template for building and deploying a custom Jupyter notebook image. This combines the functionality of the `notebook-builder` and `notebook-deployer` templates.

    * `notebook-workspace` - Template for deploying a Jupyter notebook instance which also attaches a persistent volume, and copies any Python packages and notebooks included in the image, into the persistent volume. Any work done on the notebooks, or to install additional Python packages, will survive a restart of the Jupyter notebook environment. A webdav interface is also enabled to allow remote mounting of the persistent volume to a local computer.

    In this workshop you will be using the `notebook-builder`, `notebook-deployer` and `notebook-quickstart` templates.

    To see details about the builder template and what parameters can be provided when using the template, run the command:

    ```
    oc describe template notebook-builder
    ```

    To see details about the deployer template and what parameters can be provided when using the template, run the command:

    ```
    oc describe template notebook-deployer
    ```

    To see details about the quickstart template and what parameters can be provided when using the template, run the command:

    ```
    oc describe template notebook-quickstart
    ```

    Check out the other workshops available here for more information on these and the other templates.

  title: Topic 3 - Accessing the Web Console
  assignment: |
    You can work with the templates using either the command line or the OpenShift web console. We will use the web console in this example.

    Click on the _Console_ tab in the workshop dashboard. You will be presented with the OpenShift login screen.

    ![Web Console Login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-notebooks-42/03-web-console-login.png)

    For the credentials, enter:

    * **Username:** ``developer``
    * **Password:** ``developer``

    Once you have logged in, you should be shown the list of projects you have access to. A project called ``myproject`` has already been created for you to use in this workshop.

    ![List of Projects](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-notebooks-42/03-list-of-projects.png)

    Click on ``myproject`` and you should then be at the _Overview_ page for
    the project. Select the _Developer_ perspective for the project instead of the _Adminstrator_ perspective in the left hand side menu. If necessary click on the hamburger menu icon top left of the web console to expose the left hand side menu.

    ![Add to Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-notebooks-42/03-add-to-project.png)

    As the project is currently empty, no workloads should be found and you will be presented with various options for how you can deploy an application.

    Once you have deployed a workload, you can return to this view to deploy additional applications by selecting the _+Add_ option in the left hand side menu.

  title: Topic 4 - Building the Notebook Image
  assignment: |
    In the separate workshop _Deploying a Jupyter Notebook Image_ we already saw how the `notebook-deployer` template could be used to deploy an instance of a Jupyter notebook environment. This environment was empty and you would have needed to upload any existing notebooks you wanted to use, as well as manually install into the environment any additional Python packages required by the notebooks.

    In this workshop we are going to create a custom Jupyter notebook image which includes any notebook files you require, as well as having any Python packages they need already installed. The result is a container image that can be redistributed and made available to others, or, using the same process as will be shown, someone else could build their own container image from your original files. Once the custom Jupyter notebook image has been created, we will deploy it.

    From the options for deploying applications to your project, select _From Catalog_. This will bring up the _Developer Catalog_.

    Ensure that _All Items_ is selected on the left hand side, and in the _Filter by keyword_ text entry field enter ``jupyter``. This will limit the displayed items to just the OpenShift templates you loaded.

    ![Add to Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-notebooks-42/04-jupyter-notebook-templates.png)

    Click on the tile for _Jupyter Notebook Builder_.

    This will bring up the description of the template. Click on _Instantiate Template_, which will bring up a form with the parameters for the template which you can customize.

    ![Instatiate Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/custom-notebooks-42/04-instantiate-template.png)

    The purpose of the template parameters are:

    * ``NOTEBOOK_NAME`` - The name to be given to the custom notebook image.
    * ``BUILDER_IMAGE`` - The name and version of the Jupyter notebook image to be used as the base for building the custom notebook image.
    * ``GIT_REPOSITORY_URL`` - The URL to a hosted Git repository containing the Jupyter notebook files, and a Python ``requirements.txt`` file listing any Python packages required by the notebook files.
    * ``GIT_REFERENCE`` - The branch of the Git repository to use.
    * ``CONTEXT_DIR`` - Where files to be used to build the custom notebook image are located in a sub directory of the Git repository, the name of that sub directory.

    In the ``GIT_REPOSITORY_URL`` field enter the URL:

    ``https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift/sample-notebooks``

    In the ``CONTEXT_DIR`` field enter:

    ``matplotlib``

    Click on _Create_ to instantiate the template. This will leave you on the _Template Instance Overview_ with details of what was created.

    Usually a template is used to create a deployment for an application. In this case it has created a build configuration and triggered a build of a custom notebook image, using the files held in the Git repository you provided to the template.

    To monitor the building of the custom notebook image, run:

    ```
    oc logs -f bc/custom-notebook
    ```

    The build may take a few moments to start as it pulls down the builder image to use.

    The build process will then use the builder image as a base for your custom notebook image, injecting into the image the source code files from the Git repository, and installing any Python packages listed in the Python ``requirements.txt`` file.

    One of the items created by the template is an image stream, with it defining the destination for the image which is built.

    List the image streams in the project by running:

    ```
    oc get imagestreams -o name
    ```

    You will see there are now two image streams, the `s2i-minimal-notebook` which was used as the builder image, and the the `custom-notebook` image, which was created by the build.

    Return to the web console, and click on the _+Add_ option in the left hand side menu bar.

    From the options for deploying applications to your project, select _From Catalog_. This will bring up the _Developer Catalog_.

    Ensure that _All Items_ is selected on the left hand side, and in the _Filter by keyword_ text entry field enter ``jupyter``.

    ![Add to Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/custom-notebooks-42/05-jupyter-notebook-templates.png)

    This time click on the tile for _Jupyter Notebook_.

    This will bring up the description of the template. Click on _Instantiate Template_, which will bring up a form with the parameters for the template which you can customize.

    ![Instatiate Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/custom-notebooks-42/05-instantiate-template.png)

    The purpose of the template parameters are:

    * ``APPLICATION_NAME`` - The name of the deployment.
    * ``NOTEBOOK_IMAGE`` - The name of the image stream for the Jupyter notebook image, and the version tag, which you wish to use.
    * ``NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD`` - The password used to protect access to the Jupyter notebook. This cannot be left empty.
    * ``NOTEBOOK_INTERFACE`` - The Jupyter notebook web interface to use. Setting this to ``lab`` will enable the JupyterLab web interface.
    * ``NOTEBOOK_MEMORY`` - The maximum amount of memory the Jupyter noteboook deployment is allowed to use.

    In the ``NOTEBOOK_IMAGE`` field, change the value from ``s2i-mininal-notebook:3.6`` to ``custom-notebook:latest``. This corresponds to the name of the image the build created.

    In the ``NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD`` field enter a password of ``secret``.

    When ready, click on _Create_. The _Template Instance Overview_ view for the deployment will be displayed.

    To monitor the deployment, click on the _Topology_ view in the left hand side menu.

    ![Topology View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/custom-notebooks-42/05-topology-view.png)

    The ring shown in the visualization of the deployment will change from white, indicating the deployment is pending, to light blue, indicating the application is starting, and finally blue, indicating the application is running.

    The icon top right of the ring is a short cut to access the URL for the deployment. Once the ring has turned blue indicating the application is running, click on this icon, which will open a new browser tab or window for the Jupyter notebook.

    Because a secure HTTP connection is used, but an environment may in some cases use a self signed SSL certificate, you will need to accept the certificate to proceed.

    ![Login Prompt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/custom-notebooks-42/05-notebook-login-prompt.png)

    At the login prompt, enter the password ``secret`` which you entered into the ``NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD`` field. You will then be granted access to the Jupyter notebook file browser.

    ![Classic Notebook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/custom-notebooks-42/05-classic-notebook-interface.png)

    From the file browser you will see the the Jupyter notebook file and the ``requirements.txt`` file from the Git repository. The Python packages listed in the ``requirements.txt`` file have also been installed. If you were to open the notebook file you will be able to interact with and execute the cells.

    In this configuration nothing is persistent. If the notebook instance were restarted, you would loose any work. For a persistent workspace, the ``notebook-workspace`` template can be used. Details of how to use this template are described in a separate workshop.

  title: Topic 6 - Deleting the Jupyter Notebook
  assignment: |
    When you are done with the Jupyter notebook instance you can delete it from the command line.

    To validate that you are deleting the correct resources, first run:

    ```
    oc get all --selector app=custom-notebook -o name
    ```

    This uses a label selector to reference only the resources for this deployment.

    When happy that you will be deleting the correct resources, run:

    ```
    oc delete svc,dc,route,is,secret --selector app=custom-notebook
    ```

    This will only delete the Jupyter notebook instance in this case and will not delete the custom Jupyter notebook image. For the image, run:

    ```
    oc get svc,dc,route,is,secret --selector build=custom-notebook -o name
    ```

    The label selector this time is `build=custom-notebook`.

    When happy that you will be deleting the correct resources, run:

    ```
    oc delete all --selector build=custom-notebook
    ```

    The custom Jupyter notebook image has now also been deleted.

  title: Topic 7 - Build and Deploy the Notebooks
  assignment: |
    Having built a custom Jupyter notebook image as a separate step, you can deploy as many separate instances as you need to. You just need to name each deployment differently.

    If you don't need to deploy multiple Jupyter notebook instances from the same image, or you are in a hurry, you can build the custom image and deploy it in one step using the `notebook-quickstart` template.

    Return back to the web console again, and click on the _+Add_ option in the left hand side menu bar if necessary to bring up the page of options for deploying applications to your project.

    Select _From Catalog_. This will bring up the _Developer Catalog_.

    Ensure that _All Items_ is selected on the left hand side, and in the _Filter by keyword_ text entry field enter ``jupyter``.

    This time click on the _Jupyter Notebook Quickstart_ tile.

    This will bring up the description of the template. Click on _Instantiate Template_, which will bring up a form with the parameters for the template which you can customize.

    ![Instatiate Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/custom-notebooks-42/07-instantiate-template.png)

    The purpose of the template parameters are:

    * ``APPLICATION_NAME`` - The name of the deployment.
    * ``NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD`` - The password used to protect access to the Jupyter notebook. This cannot be left empty.
    * ``NOTEBOOK_MEMORY`` - The maximum amount of memory the Jupyter noteboook deployment is allowed to use.
    * ``ENABLE_JUPYTERLAB`` - Whether the JupyterLab web interface, rather than the classic web interface, is enabled.
    * ``GIT_REPOSITORY_URL`` - The URL to a hosted Git repository containing the Jupyter notebook files, and a Python ``requirements.txt`` file listing any Python packages required by the notebook files.
    * ``GIT_REFERENCE`` - The branch of the Git repository to use.
    * ``CONTEXT_DIR`` - Where files to be used to build the custom notebook image are located in a sub directory of the Git repository, the name of that sub directory.

    You can see that with this template it combines template options required for building a custom Jupyter notebook image with those for deploying it.

    In the ``NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD`` field enter a password of ``secret``.

    In the ``GIT_REPOSITORY_URL`` field enter the URL:

    ``https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift/sample-notebooks``

    In the ``CONTEXT_DIR`` field enter:

    ``matplotlib``

    Click on _Create_ to instantiate the template. This will leave you on the _Template Instance Overview_ with details of what was created.

    To monitor the building of the custom notebook image, run:

    ```
    oc logs -f bc/custom-notebook
    ```

    To monitor the deployment, click on the _Topology_ view in the left hand side menu.

    Once the ring has turned blue indicating the application is running, click on the icon for accessing the application via its URL.

    Accept the certificate for the secure connection and enter ``secret`` for the notebook password. You should then be able to access the Jupyter notebook web interface.
