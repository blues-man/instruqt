title: Persistent Workspace for Notebooks
description: |
  The [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) web site describes Jupyter notebooks as:

  > an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

  Jupyter notebooks can be deployed direct to Linux, macOS or Windows environments, or in containerized environments such as Docker, Kubernetes and OpenShift.

  In this workshop you will learn how you can deploy a workspace for working on Jupyter notebooks which is backed by persistent storage, ensuring that any changes made to your notebook files, and any additional Python packages you manually install, are always available, even across a restart of the workspace environment.

  The examples shown will make use of sample Jupyter notebook images and templates from the [Jupyter on OpenShift](https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift) project, a community project for demonstrating how Jupyter notebooks and JupyterHub can be deployed to OpenShift.

  assignment: |
    The Jupyter on OpenShift project provides Jupyter notebook images which have been purpose built to work best with OpenShift.

    Before you can deploy these Jupyter notebook images, you first need to load the images for the Jupyter notebook application into your project in OpenShift. You only need to load this once in a project. You can then use it in creating as many different Jupyter notebook deployments as you need.

    In this workshop the step of loading the Jupyter notebook images has already been done for you.

    To verify that the images have been loaded run the command:

    ```
    oc get imagestreams -o name
    ```

    You should see that the `s2i-minimal-notebook` image stream exists.

    You can inspect the image stream for the Jupyter notebook by running:

    ```
    oc describe imagestream s2i-minimal-notebook
    ```

    You should see that the image stream includes tags for `3.5` and `3.6`. These correspond to versions of the image for Python 3.5 and Python 3.6.

  title: Topic 2 - Loading the Notebook Templates
  assignment: |
    The minimal Jupyter notebook images that have been loaded can be deployed as is, but to make it easier to secure access, add persistent storage, define resources, as well as use it as a Source-to-Image (S2I) builder to create custom Jupyter notebook images, the Jupyter on OpenShift project also provides a set of OpenShift templates.

    As with the Jupyter notebook images, for this workshop these have already been loaded for you.

    To verify that the templates have been loaded for you, run:

    ```
    oc get templates
    ```

    The purpose of the OpenShift templates which have been loaded are:

    * `notebook-deployer` - Template for deploying a Jupyter notebook image.

    * `notebook-builder` - Template for building a custom Jupyter notebook image using Source-to-Image (S2I) against a hosted Git repository. Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file of the Git repository will be installed and any files, including notebook images, will be copied into the image. The image can then be deployed using the `notebook-deployer` template.

    * `notebook-quickstart` - Template for building and deploying a custom Jupyter notebook image. This combines the functionality of the `notebook-builder` and `notebook-deployer` templates.

    * `notebook-workspace` - Template for deploying a Jupyter notebook instance which also attaches a persistent volume, and copies any Python packages and notebooks included in the image, into the persistent volume. Any work done on the notebooks, or to install additional Python packages, will survive a restart of the Jupyter notebook environment. A webdav interface is also enabled to allow remote mounting of the persistent volume to a local computer.

    In this workshop you will be using the `notebook-workspace` template.

    To see details about the workspace template and what parameters can be provided when using the template, run the command:

    ```
    oc describe template notebook-workspace
    ```

    Check out the other workshops available here for more information on the other templates.

  title: Topic 3 - Accessing the Web Console
  assignment: |
    You can work with the templates using either the command line or the OpenShift web console. We will use the web console in this example.

    Click on the _Console_ tab in the workshop dashboard. You will be presented with the OpenShift login screen.

    ![Web Console Login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-workspace-42/03-web-console-login.png)

    For the credentials, enter:

    * **Username:** ``developer``
    * **Password:** ``developer``

    Once you have logged in, you should be shown the list of projects you have access to. A project called ``myproject`` has already been created for you to use in this workshop.

    ![List of Projects](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-workspace-42/03-list-of-projects.png)

    Click on ``myproject`` and you should then be at the _Overview_ page for
    the project. Select the _Developer_ perspective for the project instead of the _Adminstrator_ perspective in the left hand side menu. If necessary click on the hamburger menu icon top left of the web console to expose the left hand side menu.

    ![Add to Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-workspace-42/03-add-to-project.png)

    As the project is currently empty, no workloads should be found and you will be presented with various options for how you can deploy an application.

    Once you have deployed a workload, you can return to this view to deploy additional applications by selecting the _+Add_ option in the left hand side menu.

  title: Topic 4 - Deploying the Jupyter Workspace
  assignment: |
    From the options for deploying applications to your project, select _From Catalog_. This will bring up the _Developer Catalog_.

    Ensure that _All Items_ is selected on the left hand side, and in the _Filter by keyword_ text entry field enter ``jupyter``. This will limit the displayed items to just the OpenShift templates you loaded.

    ![Add to Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-workspace-42/04-jupyter-notebook-templates.png)

    Click on the tile for _Jupyter Notebook Workspace_.

    This will bring up the description of the template. Click on _Instantiate Template_, which will bring up a form with the parameters for the template which you can customize.

    ![Instatiate Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-workspace-42/04-instantiate-template.png)

    The purpose of the template parameters are:

    * ``APPLICATION_NAME`` - The name of the deployment.
    * ``NOTEBOOK_IMAGE`` - The name of the image stream for the Jupyter notebook image, and the version tag, which you wish to use.
    * ``NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD`` - The password used to protect access to the Jupyter notebook. This cannot be left empty.
    * ``NOTEBOOK_INTERFACE`` - The Jupyter notebook web interface to use. Setting this to ``lab`` will enable the JupyterLab web interface.
    * ``NOTEBOOK_MEMORY`` - The maximum amount of memory the Jupyter noteboook deployment is allowed to use.
    * ``VOLUME_SIZE`` - The size of the persistent volume used to store files for the persistent workspace.

    In the ``NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD`` field enter a password of ``secret``, and then click on _Create_. The _Template Instance Overview_ view for the deployment will be displayed.

    To monitor the deployment, click on the _Topology_ view in the left hand side menu.

    ![Topology View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-workspace-42/04-topology-view.png)

    The ring shown in the visualization of the deployment will change from white, indicating the deployment is pending, to light blue, indicating the application is starting, and finally blue, indicating the application is running.

    The icon top right of the ring is a short cut to access the URL for the deployment. Once the ring has turned blue indicating the application is running, click on this icon, which will open a new browser tab or window for the Jupyter notebook.

    Because a secure HTTP connection is used, but an environment may in some cases use a self signed SSL certificate, you will need to accept the certificate to proceed.

    ![Login Prompt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-workspace-42/04-notebook-login-prompt.png)

    At the login prompt, enter the password ``secret`` which you entered into the ``NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD`` field. You will then be granted access to the Jupyter notebook file browser.

    ![Classic Notebook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-workspace-42/04-classic-notebook-interface.png)

    At this point you can create new notebooks or upload existing notebooks. If you need to install additional Python packages, when using this type of deployment you would need to start a terminal from the Jupyter notebook web interface and install the packages manually.

    In this configuration the file system where files are stored, including any Python packages which are installed, is persistent. If the notebook instance is restarted, you will  not loose any work.

  title: Topic 5 - Testing the Persistent Storage
  assignment: |
    To test that the persistent storage is working as advertised, create a new notebook file by clicking on _New_ in the Jupyter notebook file browser and select _Python 3_.

    ![Create Notebook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-workspace-42/05-create-new-notebook.png)

    This will open a new browser tab or window. Enter into the first cell:

    ``import sys; sys.version``

    and press SHIFT-ENTER. This should execute the cell and you should see output similar to:

    ![Notebook Sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-workspace-42/05-simple-notebook-file.png)

    The notebook file should be perioically saved, but to be sure, click on the save icon in the upper left and close the browser tab or window. Back in the Jupyter notebook file browser window, you should see the notebook file as ``Untitled.ipynb``.

    ![Filebrowser List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-workspace-42/05-file-browser-list.png)

    Close the browser tab or window for the Jupyter notebook file browser as well.

    Although we have closed the Jupyter notebook, it is still running. You can see the running Kubernetes pod it by running:

    ```
    oc get pods -l app=custom-notebook
    ```

    To kill the pod and cause a restart of Jupyter notebook instance run:

    ```
    oc rollout latest dc/custom-notebook
    ```

    To see when the re-deployment has completed, run:

    ```
    oc rollout status dc/custom-notebook
    ```

    This command should only return when the Jupyter notebook instance is running again.

    Return to the _Topology_ view in the web console and click on the short cut icon for accessing the application via its public URL.

    You will be asked to login again. Use ``secret`` as the password.

    Once access is granted, you should see that the notebook file you created is still present.

    To check that it is a different instance of the Jupyter notebook application, run:

    ```
    oc get pods -l app=custom-notebook
    ```

    The pod name should be different.

    If you created a _Terminal_ from the _New_ menu and had manually installed any Python packages, or had installed them through actions in the notebook file, these Python packages should also still exist after the restart.

    The ``jupyter-workspace`` template therefore gives you a persistent workspace in which to work on your Jupyter notebook files, knowing that you will not loose your work.

  title: Topic 6 - Deleting the Jupyter Notebook
  assignment: |
    When you are done with the Jupyter notebook instance you can delete it from the command line.

    To validate that you are deleting the correct resources, first run:

    ```
    oc get svc,dc,route,is,secret --selector app=custom-notebook -o name
    ```

    This uses a label selector to reference only the resources for this deployment.

    When happy that you will be deleting the correct resources, run:

    ```
    oc delete svc,dc,route,is,secret --selector app=custom-notebook
    ```
